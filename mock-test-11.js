For rolling KE = ½mv²[1 + I/(mR²)]. Solid: I = (2/5)mR², so KE₁ = (7/10)mv². Hollow: I = (2/3)mR², so KE₂ = (5/6)mv². But v depends on acceleration. For rolling: a = g sinθ/(1 + I/mR²). Solid: a₁ = 5g sinθ/7. Hollow: a₂ = 3g sinθ/5. v² ∝ a, so v₁²:v₂² = 25:21. Therefore KE₁:KE₂ = (7/5)×(25/21) = 5:3. Actually, let me be more careful. The question asks for KE ratio when both reach bottom, so they have same height drop. Using energy: mgh = ½mv² + ½Iω² = ½mv²(1 + I/mR²). For solid: v₁² = 10gh/7. For hollow: v₂² = 6gh/5. KE₁ = (7/10)mv₁² = gh×m. KE₂ = (5/6)mv₂² = gh×m. This gives 1:1 which seems wrong. Let me reconsider... For solid sphere: KE₁ = (7/10)m(10gh/7) = mgh. For hollow sphere: KE₂ = (5/6)m(6gh/5) = mgh. So both have same total KE = mgh, but the question asks for kinetic energy ratio. At bottom: KE_solid = (7/10)mv₁² where v₁² = 10gh/7, so KE_solid = mgh. Similarly KE_hollow = mgh. But this includes rotational KE. If asking for translational KE only: KE_trans_solid = ½mv₁² = 5mgh/7. KE_trans_hollow = ½mv₂² = 3mgh/5. Ratio = (5/7):(3/5) = 25:21. Still doesn't match options. Let me check the physics again..."
